# Overview

This is my first big project as a young C++ programmer so please don't judge the code quality too hard. My navie goal back then was to write something faster than the available Java servers but it didn't really work out. Part of the problem was that I really underestimated the expense of mutual exclusion back then (every player has about 4 threads for themselves). Also IO was kind of whacky as I did tons of system calls with really small data amounts. I suppose you could find tons more examples like that but it was a good learning experience.
